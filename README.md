## Welcome to the portfolio of Samuel Dowling

This site is a front-end for my GitHub profile, and serves to showcase the projects I've been working on. 

### Status

Currently, this page uses a default GitHub theme. In the future, this will be replaced by a website that I create. Practically, this means a transition from using the README.md markdown file to create content, to an index.html file for content. This may or may not make use of Jekyll Themes.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/samuel-emrys/samuel-emrys.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
